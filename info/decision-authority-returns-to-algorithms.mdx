2. The study evaluates the returns of algorithms in an Inspections Department, demonstrating that algorithms, both simple and sophisticated, outperform human rankings in predicting health code violations in restaurants, with substantial gains in identifying violations.

3. Despite the predictive gains from algorithms, inspectors often override algorithmic recommendations based on their discretion, leading to decisions that do not necessarily improve outcomes, indicating a potential misalignment between algorithmic predictions and inspectors' decision-making processes.

4. Interviews with 55 departments revealed a consistent provision of decision authority to inspectors, suggesting a widespread recognition of the value of human judgment in decision-making processes, despite the availability of algorithmic tools.

5. The study suggests that integrating data into the decision process through simple heuristics yields the greatest gains in decision quality, highlighting the importance of the context in which algorithms are used and how decision authority is allocated.

6. The findings underscore the crucial role of decision authority in the effectiveness of algorithms in decision-making, suggesting that the design and management of decision authority significantly impact the value organizations can capture from using predictive analytics.

7. The research indicates that the gains from using algorithms come from integrating any data into the decision process, rather than increasing algorithmic sophistication or adding more data, challenging the notion that more complex algorithms necessarily provide better predictions.

8. The study's analysis reveals that inspectors were less likely to inspect algorithm-recommended restaurants, diminishing the benefits of using algorithms, and tended to prioritize restaurants based on their own rankings, potentially reducing the effectiveness of algorithms in decision-making.

9. The paper concludes that managing decision authority is crucial when using algorithms as decision aids, as the returns to algorithmic sophistication may be limited in some contexts, and organizations should evaluate the returns to algorithmic sophistication in each context.

10. The study contributes to the understanding of how the use of algorithms as decision aids translates into improvements in managerial decisions, emphasizing the need for more research on how decision-makers leverage their contextual knowledge and discretion when faced with algorithmic inputs.

3. Other potential explanations for inspectors not using their decision authority to improve decisions include algorithm aversion, private information, and social relationships with owners.
4. Contact with inspectional departments in the largest 200 metropolitan areas in the United States revealed that most believed their historical data was insufficient for useful predictions or lacked the technical capability for using algorithms.
5. Departments using algorithms to guide decisions reported dissipated informational gains from using algorithms.
6. Managing decision authority is crucial when using algorithms as decision aids, as the returns to algorithmic sophistication may be limited in some contexts.
7. Organizations investing in data and AI should evaluate the returns to algorithmic sophistication in each context and consider secondary measures to assess whether decision authority is being used to achieve other organizational goals.

### Limitations of analysis for policy prescriptions and predictions in practice.

\- The analysis in the paper is limited by the assumption that the department's objective of identifying violations is given, which may not account for the deterrence effect of inspection decisions, the accuracy of violations as a measure of health risks, and other competing policy goals that were not quantified.
\- Direct policy prescriptions should not be made based on this analysis due to the likelihood of deviations from the assumptions in practice.
\- The focus of the paper is on understanding how the predictions were used, rather than providing specific policy recommendations.

### Optimal Decision-Making: Balancing Information and Heuristics in Management

1. More information and computation may not necessarily improve predictions for managerial decisions, as research on heuristics shows an inverse\-U\-shaped relationship between accuracy and the amount of information used.
2. Simple rules and heuristics may be more accurate than complex strategies in contexts with higher uncertainty and redundancy, as they can reduce variance and mental costs for decision\-makers.
3. The use of simpler algorithmic decision aids may have the potential to help decision\-makers as much as complex ones, as qualitative research in strategy suggests.
4. Decision\-makers may not leverage potential prediction gains from algorithms due to the richness of objective functions in organizational decisions that may not be captured by algorithms.
5. Managers with decision authority may have contextual knowledge on multiple objectives and their relative weights, which may constrain their choices even if algorithms provide better predictions.
6. Current versions of algorithms may have misaligned objective functions relative to true organizational objectives, which managers can help correct.
7. Managers may actively dissipate informational gains by using their discretion and private knowledge in decision\-making processes.

### Preference for own forecasts over algorithms in managerial decision-making.

1. Managers may reject algorithmic recommendations not because they are detrimental to other objectives, but because they prefer their own forecasts over algorithmic predictions, even when algorithms are more accurate overall.
2. This preference for one's opinions over others' advice is consistent with research on overconfidence and resistance to advice and change among professionals with specialized knowledge.
3. Managers may not recognize improvements in predictions made by algorithmic sophistication and may use their discretion to dissipate potential informational gains.
4. Limited empirical insight exists on how decision\-makers in organizations leverage their contextual knowledge on organizational objectives to inform decisions when faced with algorithmic inputs.
5. Examining how decision\-makers in organizations use their contextual knowledge can provide insight on the role of decision authority in capturing the returns to algorithms.

7. The study focuses on the gains in prediction and the role of decision authority within a real organizational setting.

### Optimizing restaurant inspections for public health and efficiency

1. Inspectors in the City were tasked with allocating resources to inspect restaurants based on their judgment, with a limited number of inspectors and time available for inspections.
2. Inspections revealed varying levels of violations in restaurants, with different weights assigned to violations based on severity.
3. The main objective of the department was to identify and address establishments posing the highest risk to public health, requiring inspectors to prioritize inspections based on likelihood of violation.
4. Secondary objectives included reducing travel distance, targeting overdue inspections, and prioritizing serious violations and popular restaurants, with the goal of improving decision\-making without diminishing focus on high\-risk establishments.
5. Inspectors' behavior and use of discretion were evaluated based on their ability to meet department objectives, with data accessibility from both historical administrative records and external sources offering potential for improving predictions and decision\-making.

### Optimizing restaurant inspections to prioritize public health risks

1. The weighting scheme for restaurant inspections was provided by the City.
2. The identified objectives for restaurant inspections include deterring violations, ensuring fairness in inspection allocation, and identifying restaurants posing the highest risk to public health.
3. Discussions with the department emphasized the importance of focusing on identifying restaurants with the highest public health risk.

### Optimizing restaurant inspection targeting for organizational efficiency and performance.

1. Inspectors prioritize higher\-risk restaurants based on experience and motivation, as their performance affects promotions and workload.
2. Customer complaints trigger immediate inspections, usually from restaurants with a high number of violations, allowing inspectors to avoid uncompensated workload increases.
3. Improving inspection targeting directly impacts organizational performance by better allocating inspectors' scarce time.
4. Most inspectional departments in the US run behind their target number of inspections and prioritize inspections based on likelihood of violations.
5. The City evaluated three methods to predict restaurant violations: business\-as\-usual, a data\-poor algorithm, and a data\-rich algorithm.
6. The data\-rich algorithm, trained on historical violations and Yelp data, was one of the winning algorithms from a crowdsourced tournament and provided theoretical efficiency gains of 40% relative to inspectors.
7. The data\-rich algorithm used a more sophisticated model and richer data than the data\-poor algorithm, reflecting common practices by firms investing in upgraded technologies and complex data.

### Algorithm importance in study rankings and findings explained in detail.

1. The algorithm used in the pilot study was maintained and run by the researchers.
2. The rankings generated by the algorithm were crucial for the study.
3. The details of the algorithm and its operation are provided in Appendix A.
4. The findings of the study are based on the rankings generated by the algorithm.
5. The unique contribution of the study lies in the use of this algorithm for ranking purposes.

### Comparing inspector rankings with algorithmic support in restaurant inspections.

1. The City implemented a new approach to restaurant inspections by using predictive algorithms to supplement inspectors' rankings, providing a mechanism to influence which restaurants were inspected and observing how inspectors used their decision authority.

2. The City's data team hired PhD\-trained scientists with relevant experience in policy and technology to develop and implement the predictive algorithms, which were well\-respected and viewed as competent within the City.

3. Inspectors were asked to first rank their own choices before algorithms were applied, allowing for a comparison of their decisions with and without algorithmic support, and variation in algorithmic sophistication could shed light on how different algorithms impact outcomes.

4. The data collected for the study included anonymized data on rankings and inspection results, but empirical challenges arose due to inspectors inspecting substantially fewer restaurants than assigned, with only 243 out of 1042 restaurants inspected during the pilot period.

5. Inspectors' limited capacity to inspect all assigned restaurants was attributed to higher\-priority inspections of hospitals, nursing homes, and schools, as well as sick inspectors unable to undertake inspections for the full period.

### Comparing Inspection Outcomes: Algorithmic vs. Inspector-Ranked Top Restaurants

1. The City's data team included more restaurants on the inspection docket to ensure all inspector\-ranked restaurants were inspected, sourcing an equal number of restaurants from algorithmically\-ranked lists.
2. The docket generation process was modified to include restaurants that had not been inspected from previous dockets, with a cap at 47, potentially leading to an imbalance in sourcing restaurants from each method.
3. Rankings from all three methods were not available for all restaurants, leading to inconsistencies in rankings and the need to focus the analysis on evaluating inspected restaurants ranked in the top\-20 by algorithms and inspectors.
4. By focusing on the top\-20 ranked restaurants, the study aims to compare inspection outcomes across comparable rankings under each method to determine if restaurants ranked highly by algorithms have a higher number of violations.
5. The subsample for analysis consists of 174 out of 243 inspected restaurants, representing a subset of 674 restaurants ranked in the top\-20 by any method, with overlaps between methods and varying rankings.
6. The study assesses the gains from using algorithms by comparing the number of violations found across restaurants ranked in the top\-20 by algorithmic methods compared to inspectors using a specified model for analysis.
7. The model includes parameters to represent the mean expected difference in weighted violations for restaurants ranked by data\-poor and data\-rich algorithms relative to inspectors, as well as accounting for overlaps between methods in ranking highly\-violated restaurants.

### Optimizing restaurant inspections: Algorithms vs inspectors in identifying violations.

1. The study estimates a model with and without inspector fixed effects to explore the robustness of results across different samples and thresholds.
2. Algorithms identified restaurants with over 50% more violations on average compared to those prioritized by inspectors, suggesting large gains from using algorithms.
3. The largest gains from using algorithms appear to come from integrating any data, rather than algorithmic sophistication.
4. Inspectors were only about two\-thirds as likely to follow algorithmic recommendations, reducing the informational gains from algorithms.
5. There is little evidence that inspectors substantially improved inspection decisions with respect to other organizational objectives.
6. Restaurants ranked by algorithms alone had significantly more violations on average compared to those ranked by inspectors alone.
7. The gains from using algorithms over inspectors were statistically significant, representing a difference of targeting a restaurant with one more Level III violation.
8. The differences in violations identified by algorithms emerged across the distribution, with restaurants ranked highly by both algorithms having the most violations.
9. The gains in the study's setting came from integrating any data into the process, rather than using more data or sophisticated algorithms.
10. The results were qualitatively robust across different samples and subsamples, indicating consistent findings.
11. Both algorithms outperformed inspector rankings on violations by over 50%, suggesting the marginal benefit of additional data may be limited in this case.

### Predicting restaurant violations: algorithms vs. human inspectors.

1. Algorithmic sophistication may not always lead to substantially larger gains in prediction, especially with smaller datasets.
2. Simple heuristics can be effective, particularly when driven by data rather than human decision\-makers.
3. The method used by inspectors to rank restaurants may not necessarily reflect their predictions of violations.
4. The assumption that inspector rankings prioritize restaurants with higher violations influences interpretations of the data.
5. The table presents violations found across restaurants prioritized by inspectors and algorithms, comparing different methods and approaches.
6. The comparison of violations across different methods highlights the effectiveness of data\-rich and data\-poor algorithms, as well as the combination of both.
7. The analysis includes a weighted sum of Level I, II, and III violations to provide a comprehensive view of restaurant rankings.
8. The study evaluates the performance of algorithms in predicting violations compared to human inspectors, with varying levels of success.
9. The findings suggest that a combination of algorithmic approaches and human expertise may yield the best results in predicting violations in restaurants.

### Inspectors Prioritization Beyond Violations: Implications for Algorithmic Predictions

1. The assumption that algorithmic predictions outperform inspectors' prioritization in terms of identifying violations may not hold true if inspectors prioritize based on secondary organizational objectives beyond violations alone.
2. The relative gains from data\-rich and data\-poor algorithms compared to inspectors may be overestimated if inspectors consider secondary objectives in their rankings.
3. Inspectors tend to list restaurants in closer proximity to each other and rank more overdue restaurants compared to algorithms, suggesting consideration of secondary organizational objectives.
4. Inspectors do not show a substantial preference for popular restaurants based on Yelp reviews and ratings in their rankings.
5. The prediction gains from algorithms may be smaller than estimated due to inspectors' consideration of secondary objectives.
6. Prior violations play a significant role in predicting current violations, but there may be reasons why a city might not want to use them to guide inspection decisions.
7. Heterogeneity in violations may be driven by factors that a city may not want to consider in inspection decisions.
8. The analysis shows differences in violation severity across all inspected restaurants ranked in the top\-20 by method, indicating potential limitations in using prior violations for guidance.

### Challenges of Predictive Inspection Systems in Regulatory Enforcement

1. Relying heavily on past data for inspections may be problematic due to concerns about inspector stringency and strategic behavior leading to regulatory capture.
2. Using historical violations to guide decisions may reduce the efficacy of the inspection process and change the role of predictions in inspection decisions.
3. The net benefit of changing the targeting system for inspections is unclear, considering implementation costs and the dynamic nature of inspections.
4. Predicting violations is only part of the managerial problem, and inspections should not be prioritized solely based on predictions.
5. Despite algorithms being able to improve inspector rankings, the gains did not fully translate into better decisions about which restaurants to inspect.
6. Inspectors were less likely to inspect algorithmically\-ranked restaurants compared to those they had ranked themselves.

### Comparing attributes and violations of top-ranked restaurants by method.

1. Panel A compares the attributes of restaurants ranked in the top\-20 by each method, showing differences in characteristics such as data richness, Yelp rating, review count, type of cuisine, restaurant age, price range, acceptance of reservations, table service, and days since last inspection.
2. Panel B compares the attributes of inspected and non\-inspected restaurants among all top\-20 ranked restaurants, highlighting differences in characteristics such as chain affiliation, Yelp rating, review count, type of cuisine, restaurant age, price range, acceptance of reservations, table service, and days since last inspection.
3. Panel C compares the number of violations by severity across inspected restaurants from each of the lists, showing differences in the severity of violations detected by inspectors for restaurants ranked in the top\-20 by different methods.

### Inspector bias in restaurant prioritization over algorithm recommendations: implications discussed.

1. Inspectors were more likely to prioritize restaurants based on their own rankings rather than algorithms, as shown by Table 3.
2. Figure 3 demonstrates that most inspectors inspected more restaurants that they prioritized compared to those ranked by algorithms, suggesting limited improvements for managerial decisions with algorithms.
3. The potential deviation of inspectors from algorithmic recommendations poses a challenge for organizations in capturing gains from algorithms in practice.
4. There is a concern that inspectors may have selected algorithm\-ranked restaurants with higher likelihoods of violation, potentially biasing the results.
5. The study explores whether inspectors chose higher\-ranked restaurants on the algorithm lists and whether the gains from algorithms primarily stem from the top\-ranked restaurants.

### Inspectors Bias in Ranking Restaurants: Analysis of Inspection Records

1. The study uses inspection records up to spring 2022 to analyze inspection results on all restaurants in the sample inspected after the pilot.
2. The researchers test for differences in average ranking by method for inspected restaurants, excluding any that were ranked by multiple methods.
3. If inspectors cherry\-picked higher\-ranked restaurants on algorithmic lists, then the average ranking of restaurants on algorithmic lists should be smaller than those on the inspector\-generated lists.
4. The point estimates suggest a slight bias in the opposite direction, with restaurants ranked by inspectors alone occupying higher ranking positions compared to those by the algorithms, although differences are small and imprecise.
5. The percentage inspected by method across inspectors is plotted in Figure 3, showing the percentage of inspected and top\-20 ranked restaurants by method for each inspector.
6. The figure indicates the percentage of inspector\-only ranked restaurants in the full sample of top\-20 ranked restaurants, highlighting potential non\-compliance by inspectors.

### Ranking distribution impact on algorithmic restaurant inspection effectiveness.

1. The results are unlikely to be driven by observing different parts of the ranking distribution for each method.
2. There is little evidence that the gains from algorithms emerge from a particular part of the ranking distribution.
3. Coefficients on interactions with rank are fairly small for both data\-rich and data\-poor algorithms.
4. Data on restaurant inspections show gains in violations flagged by algorithms compared to inspectors alone.
5. The passage of time may introduce some error in estimating outcomes, but it is unlikely to affect restaurants ranked by methods differently.
6. The measured prediction gains from algorithms over inspector rankings are unlikely to be fully explained by selection alone.
7. Inspectors do not appear to have chosen substantially more violation\-prone restaurants from algorithmically\-ranked lists compared to their own.
8. Inspectors may not have been making tradeoffs using private information to identify more violations.
9. The results suggest that the gains from algorithms are not solely due to selection bias.

### Effectiveness of data-rich algorithms in predicting violations in inspections.

1. The study examines the robustness of gains from algorithms in predicting violations across inspections data up to 2022.
2. Results show that using a data\-rich algorithm alone leads to consistently lower total violations compared to using a data\-poor algorithm alone or a combination of both algorithms.
3. When inspectors use a data\-rich algorithm, there is a significant decrease in total violations, indicating the effectiveness of this approach.
4. The combination of inspector and data\-poor algorithm also shows a decrease in total violations, but not as significant as when using a data\-rich algorithm.
5. The study includes various sample restrictions to test the robustness of the results, showing consistent patterns across different sample sizes and rankings.
6. The findings suggest that incorporating data\-rich algorithms in inspections can lead to more accurate and efficient identification of violations in restaurants.
7. The study contributes to the understanding of the impact of algorithms on inspection outcomes and highlights the importance of utilizing data\-rich approaches for better regulatory enforcement.

### Inspector decision-making and organizational objectives: Algorithm vs. human choice.

1. The study examines the differences between algorithms and inspectors in decision\-making processes, suggesting that selection is not likely to change the results significantly.

2. Inspectors do not appear to use their decision authority to improve organizational objectives such as reducing travel costs, targeting overdue inspections, prioritizing popular restaurants, or focusing on higher\-level violations.

3. Inspectors often did not follow algorithms, leading to decisions that worsened organizational objectives.

4. Comparison of distances traveled by inspectors to the next restaurant with distances to algorithm\-ranked restaurants not inspected shows that inspectors often had closer algorithmically\-ranked options available but chose to travel further.

5. The lack of substantial improvement in organizational objectives by inspectors suggests a disconnect between decision\-making processes and secondary objectives.

### Inspector behavior and outcomes in restaurant inspection decision-making.

\- Inspectors generally traveled farther than the closest algorithm\-ranked restaurant, even when only conducting regular restaurant inspections
\- Inspectors did not significantly prioritize overdue inspections, restaurant popularity, or violation severity in their inspection decisions
\- Algorithm\-ranked restaurants that were inspected had more violations in all three risk levels compared to inspector\-ranked restaurants that were inspected
\- Inspectors did not ultimately improve upon secondary objectives on average, but there is suggestive evidence that they sought to improve on them, especially for overdue inspections
\- Inspectors may have deviated from algorithmic predictions due to their own priors, such as viewing certain restaurant features as correlated with violations

### Effectiveness of inspectors vs algorithms in identifying high-risk inspections.

1. Inspectors were more effective than algorithms in identifying high\-risk inspections.
2. The analysis focused on inspections in wards assigned to a single inspector due to data limitations.
3. Yelp ratings and review numbers may not accurately reflect restaurant popularity.
4. Inspectors may have improved upon the objective of restaurant popularity more than observed empirically.
5. Non\-inspected restaurants had slightly higher average number of reviews.

### Inspectors prioritize older, lower-priced businesses; algorithm use questioned.

1. Inspectors prioritize older businesses in their rankings, with chains and seafood restaurants receiving lesser priority.
2. Businesses with lower prices and without reservation or table service offerings are also given higher priority by inspectors.
3. The use of algorithms to supplement inspectors' lists may have led to some dissipation of gains, as inspectors may have deviated from algorithmic recommendations.
4. The department chose not to explicitly communicate that recommendations were driven by algorithms to reduce algorithm aversion.
5. Inspectors did not hold on to their original rankings, indicating some level of trust in the lists provided.
6. Inspectors may have deviated from algorithmic recommendations due to regulatory capture, but this appears unlikely due to the rotation of inspectors and lack of opportunity to build relationships.
7. The number of days overdue for inspections varies between restaurants ranked by inspectors and algorithms alone.

### Managing decision authority and discretion in algorithmic decision-making processes.

1. Inspectors may prioritize personal preferences or objectives, such as maintaining their rankings to avoid being perceived as incompetent or to resist organizational changes they disagree with.
2. The docket presented as a guide may have been perceived as too ambitious, leading to demotivation among inspectors.
3. Despite potential alternative explanations, it is likely that inspectors did not use their discretion to improve decisions according to the department's objectives.
4. Organizations using algorithms as decision aids should consider managing decision authority to ensure effective decision\-making.
5. Decision\-makers may struggle to apply judgment when using algorithms, and traditional decision\-making rules may hinder discretion.
6. Evidence suggests challenges in managing professional workforces with specialized knowledge who resist advice.
7. Decision authority allocation may depend on organizational context, and the value of discretion may change as decision\-makers observe algorithm performance.
8. Algorithms may be less valuable in practice if discretion is highly valuable and implementation is complex or costly.
9. Decision authority should be considered alongside technical investment for effective decision\-making.
10. Findings may be limited to the specific context of the department that ran the pilot, raising questions about generalizability.
11. Interviews with inspectional departments across the US were conducted to explore perspectives on algorithmic sophistication and inspector discretion.

### Departmental cooperation in study interviews: willingness and potential reluctance.

\- The researchers conducted interviews with multiple departments to gather data for their study.
\- The majority of departments were willing to be interviewed, showing a high level of cooperation.
\- Only one department refused to be interviewed, indicating a potential reluctance to participate in the study.
\- This level of cooperation from most departments suggests a positive reception to the research and a willingness to engage with the study's objectives.

### Challenges and Benefits of Using Data for Inspection Prioritization

1. Many departments did not use data to prioritize inspections due to perceived need for more data or technical capability to integrate predictive algorithms.
2. Most departments valued retaining managerial decision authority, indicating wider practical implications beyond the pilot study.
3. Some departments attempted using algorithmic rules or software for inspections, but many eventually abandoned more sophisticated solutions for simpler models.
4. Lack of data and technical capability was a key barrier for departments not using data to guide decisions, despite historical inspections data availability.
5. Departments that ran behind inspection targets may have benefitted from using data to prioritize inspections.
6. Most departments allocated full decision authority to inspectors, with high value placed on inspector discretion in prioritizing inspections.
7. Inspectors were seen as possessing private knowledge of businesses that could better predict violations, based on training, experience, and first\-hand knowledge.
8. Inspectors were also valued for their organizational knowledge on other objectives, such as balancing travel costs based on geographic distance.

### Maximizing Efficiency Through Remote Inspections for Inspectors

\- Efficiency in inspections is crucial
\- Inspectors should not waste time driving long distances
\- Remote inspections can be a solution to reduce travel time
\- Utilizing technology for remote inspections can improve efficiency
\- Remote inspections can save time and resources
\- The importance of minimizing travel for inspectors is emphasized

### Optimizing Food Safety Inspections: Algorithmic Decision Support in Practice

\- Inspectors should focus on high\-violating restaurants in one area to be more effective in ensuring food safety.
\- The severity of violations differs between small and large restaurants, with temperature issues being more critical for smaller establishments.
\- Providing inspectors with decision authority is valued, but many do not regularly utilize data and algorithms to guide their decisions.
\- Usage of algorithmic recommendations by inspectors varies based on tenure, with lower usage among those with more experience.
\- Limited usage of algorithms by inspectors hinders the potential gains in identifying violations compared to inspectors alone.
\- Decision authority is a relevant consideration for organizations using algorithms as decision aids, with potential benefits beyond just improving decision\-making.
\- Organizations should weigh the benefits of analytics against potential costs and unintended consequences when implementing algorithms for decision\-making at scale.

### Effective decision-making processes for successful large-scale strategy implementation.

1. The importance of managing decision authority is highlighted in implementing approaches at scale.
2. This emphasizes the need for effective decision\-making processes in order to successfully implement strategies on a large scale.

### Optimizing decision-making with algorithms while retaining human discretion.

1. Simple algorithms based on historical inspection data outperformed human rankings in prioritizing restaurants for inspection.
2. Despite the predictive power of algorithms, inspectors often chose to prioritize restaurants based on their own rankings, leading to suboptimal decision\-making.
3. Managing decision authority is crucial for organizations, as some may choose not to use algorithms even if they have predictive power.
4. The primary goal of departments may vary, and the accuracy of data and biases in violations can impact the effectiveness of algorithms.
5. Decision contexts with moderate complexity may benefit from human supervision alongside algorithmic inputs.
6. Careful consideration of how decision authority is allocated and managed is essential, but removing human decision\-makers entirely may pose risks.
7. Discretion in decision\-making may be important for reasons beyond decision quality, such as maintaining the well\-being of inspectors.
8. Organizations need to find ways to capture value from algorithms while retaining managerial discretion and considering tradeoffs.
9. Further research is needed to explore how decision\-makers can better apply their private knowledge in decision\-making processes and how decision processes can be redesigned for improved outcomes.

### Enhancing decision-making through human preferences in algorithmic processes.

1. Redesigned decision\-making processes, such as incorporating human preferences into algorithms, may offer a promising direction for future work in organizations.
2. While organizations often rely on algorithmic recommendations for decision\-making, there are other possibilities that may provide better options in certain contexts.
3. Incorporating human preferences into algorithms can enhance decision\-making outcomes in specific situations.

### Spatial distribution of algorithm vs inspector-ranked restaurants for consumer choice.

\- The mean distance to the closest algorithm\-ranked restaurant not inspected was 0.21 miles, indicating that algorithm\-ranked restaurants are closer to each other compared to inspector\-ranked restaurants.
\- In contrast, the mean distance to the closest inspector\-ranked restaurant not inspected was 0.53 miles, suggesting that inspector\-ranked restaurants are farther apart from each other.
\- This disparity in distances between algorithm\-ranked and inspector\-ranked restaurants highlights a potential difference in the spatial distribution of these two types of rankings.
\- The findings imply that algorithm\-ranked restaurants may be clustered closer together geographically, while inspector\-ranked restaurants are more spread out.
\- The spatial distribution of restaurants based on different ranking methods could have implications for consumer choice, accessibility, and overall dining experience.
